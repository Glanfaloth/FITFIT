# FIT FIT (HackZurich2020)

## Inspiration
A love of leveraging technology to improve life quality!

## What it does
This app allows you to learn a new language while doing exercise, in a fun and gamified AR environment (thanks to the Huawei HMS SDK)! You are presented with a word in a foreign language, which you must translate. If you do not know the translation of the word, you instead have to perform a specific comedic yoga position in order to pass the round and earn a point.

## How we built it
With patience and coffee :)

## Challenges we ran into
The hardest part of the challenge was actually setting up the environment and finding a framework that worked for us. We spent half of the time setting up the environment.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We persevered, even when nothing was working. Although we only got most of the work done through the last night (without getting a wink of sleep), we preserved without losing hope, and all learnt something new.

## What we learned
Android Studio, Java and using the HMS Core!

## What's next for FIT FIT
- Adding a multiplayer mode (competitive mode)
- Improving the integration between voice recognition and position matching
- Making the user interface more beautiful
- Adding a larger database of languages and vocabulary

## Built With
HMS Core (ML Kit), Android Studio, Java, XML
