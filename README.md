# FIT FIT (HackZurich2020)

This project was made for HackZurich 2020, and was the 1st place winner for Huawei's brief "Unleash Innovation With HMS Core"!

## Inspiration
A love of leveraging technology to improve life quality!

## What it does
This app allows you to learn a new language while doing exercise, in a fun and gamified AR environment (thanks to the Huawei HMS SDK)! You are presented with a word in a foreign language, which you must translate. If you do not know the translation of the word, you instead have to perform a specific comedic yoga position in order to pass the round and earn a point.

## How we built it
With patience and coffee :)

## What's next for FIT FIT
- Adding a multiplayer mode (competitive mode)
- Improving the integration between voice recognition and position matching
- Making the user interface more beautiful
- Adding a larger database of languages and vocabulary

## Built With
HMS Core (ML Kit), Android Studio, Java, XML
